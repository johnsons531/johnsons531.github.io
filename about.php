			<h1>My Resume</h1>
			<p>
				All of my work experience is detailed on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsons531/" title="Sarah Johnson on LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>.
				<br>
				Recent work experience can also be viewed here as a <a href="JohnsonSarah_Resume.pdf" title="Resume for Sarah Johnson">pdf</a>.
			</p>

			<h1>How I Work</h1>
			<p>
				Inspired by the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/how-i-work">Lifehacker series</a> of the same name, I am sharing my current setup with the world.
			</p>

			<h2>Hardware</h2>

			<h3><a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/yoga-laptop-series/yoga-laptop-13/" title="Lenovo Yoga">Lenovo Yoga</a></h3>

			<p>
				My husband's "new Windows 8 computer" is now my primary machine. After unintentionally parting with a laptop, I needed a loaner for a class I was teaching. I continued to use this loaner and, although it's 2 years old and needs some cleaning (external and internal), it is now my primary laptop. The keyboard feels good and the touch screen makes using Windows 8 manageable. I regularly use over half the 8GB of RAM and I would like a more powerful processor but it works reliably.
			</p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.sony-asia.com/product/vpcs113fg" title="Vaio by Sony">Sony Vaio</a></h3>

			<p>
				This laptop (c.2009) is a hand-me-down from my husband who got a new Windows 8 computer. It happened one morning when I spilled a fresh mug of hot tea on my Dell Latitude. The Vaio was only supposed to be a stand-in but after setting it up with lubuntu, I've gotten used to it. And I like being different, having to use a converter for the plug because the computer is originally from Australia. However, fixing the Latitude is still on my to do list. I really like that computer a lot. The hardware is just a bit better than the Vaio.
			</p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" title="Vaio by Sony">Macbook Pro</a></h3>

			<p>
				I finally caved in and acquired a Mac. It's been <a href="http://cybersarahj.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/return-to-childhood/" title="Return to Childhood: Re-experiencing Mac Ownership">15 years since I last used one</a> but figured I should become familiar with them once again. Especially since the majority of people in the classes I've taught have Macs and it's difficult to give instructions when I don't know even the keyboard commands. I get how easy to use Macs are and why they're so popular. But I still prefer linux.
			</p>

			<h2>Operating System</h2>

			<h3><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/is-is/windows-8/why-windows">Windows 8.1</a></h3>

			<p>
				As many critics have said, it's not as bad as I thought. Having avoided Windows 8 until now, only exploring it enough to know that I didn't want it, I am now using it as my primary operating system. Fortunately, I am not programming on a regular basis or my frustration level would be much higher. I have the added bonus of a touch screen laptop which makes it a bit easier. There are also many improvements for programming on Windows such as <a href="https://msysgit.github.io/" title="Git for Windows">Git Bash</a> which is easy to install and includes <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/gitk" title="GiTK">GitK</a> by default. But setting up an SSH key is still too much work for occasional coding.
			</p>

			<h3><a href="http://lubuntu.net">lubuntu</a></h3>

			<p>
				How in love am I? I made my boyfriend jealous. He wants to set up a dual boot on his Windows computer now. It was only a few years ago that I was first exposed to linux and I knew I wanted to use it but I wasn't quite ready. I took baby steps and, after learning Ruby on Rails with mentors on Mac, I finally made the switch. I run <a href="http://xubuntu.org">xubuntu</a> in my office but I think it's too large for a laptop. Portable computers should be just that: portable and lightweight (physically and logically).
			</p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/osx-retina/">OS X Maverick</a></h3>

			<p>
				Maverick is the great unknown for me. I've never learned much about Mac OS versions because I've never used them. Now that I have one I need to know what it can do and so I have my homework cut out for me. The fun part of Mac OS seems to be its easy integration between multiple devices. Unfortunately I only have one Apple device and no plans to get any more. Again, something else to have fun exploring!
			</p>

			<h2>Text Editor</h2>

			<h3><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a></h3>

			<p>
				Everyone in the programming world is singing the praises of Sublime Text 2. I don't think I need to say much more except listen to the advice to spend time configuring it to your liking. I'm still figuring that one out as I go. The current color theme I'm using is Espresso Libre for the few extra syntax highlights it adds to html, such as color coding the brackets and attributes. The default Monokai works well too.
			</p>

			<h2>Web Hosting</h2>

			<h3><a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a></h3>

			<p>
				It's free! Well the EC2 was for the first year I used it. Not the best interface and I probably didn't do something properly when setting up the computer, but I got it to work. Yes, it took at least 12 hours but I learned a lot! And did I mention it was free? Recommended only for hackers and those who really want to get their hands dirty with linux. However! If you want to learn some basic linux, I might be co-teaching a class soon on how to set up your own web server with AWS!
